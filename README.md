> Manati Drupal Starter Kit Generator

## What's in the box?

Using this generator; you'll get a folder with the below listed structure ready to start working with Drupal using modern and cool technologies like [drupalvm](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/), [behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat) (using selenium for running JS tests), [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [aquifer](https://github.com/aquifer/aquifer), [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/) and more.

Out of the box; you'll get the necessary stuff for building your Drupal site using aquifer, using a virtual machine (created with vagrant and provisioned with ansible); with useful tools to check code quality (eslint, phplint, drupalcs) and some scripts for day-to-day tasks (generate settings, install site, run behat, verify features status).

Besides that; you'll get a [Wercker](http://wercker.com/) config file ready to create a wercker app the with necessary build steps and [Pantheon](http://pantheon.io/) deploy. You'll also get the same (but *untested*) for [CircleCI](http://circleci.com/) (without the Pantheon deploy stuff).

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-mdsk using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-mdsk
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo mdsk
```
